# Covid-Update
The covid update App fetches the data from a Rest API and displays it to the user. The initial page has a page that by default shows the data of India. It can later be changed by clicking on the country name and selecting a desired name from the list of countries available.

To run this app:
1. Clone this repository
2. Download and extract the code
3. Create a new project in your Android Studio with empty activity.
4. Paste the src file inside the app folder of your newly created project by the extracted folder.
5. Copy paste the dependencies from the build file in   Gradle Script -> build.gradle.

Feel free to contact incase of any issues.
